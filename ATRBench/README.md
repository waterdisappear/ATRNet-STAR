## ATRBench

Here, we describe the experimental settings in Table 1, including 2 SOC settings sampled from similar distributions and 5 EOC settings with obvious condition and distribution shifts.

**SOC and EOC settings -** SOC settings are those where the training and test sets have similar imaging conditions, and we have SOC-40 and SOC-50 settings. EOC settings are those where there is a significant domain shift between the training set and the test set, such as variation in imaging conditions and target state. 

*SOC-40* is created from a random data sample with a 7:3 training-to-test ratio. 

*SOC-50* randomly selects data with a similar amount of MSTAR ten classes, and we combine our dataset with MSTAR. 

*EOC-Scene* uses simple scenes (sandstone and bare soil) as the training set and complex scenes (urban, factory, and woodland) as the test set.

*EOC-Depression* is the training set with a 15Â° depression angle and the test set with 30Â°, 45Â° and 60Â°. 
*EOC-Azimuth* means that training has limited target azimuth angles within 0Â°~60Â°, and the test has other angles. Imaging angle and geometry variation can change target signatures and background clutter. 
*EOC-band* and *EOC-polarization* are designed to test the effect of different bands and change from HH-polarization to other polarizations on recognition, respectively.

Simple scenes are sandstone and bare soil, and complex scenes are urban, factory, and woodland. The separate labeling of the ground distance and slant distance images results in their numbers of annotations not being strictly corresponding. \# Types.: Number of object types. 
Dep.: Depression angle. Azi.: Target azimuth angle. Pol.: Polarization. # Img. (Ground): Number of images in ground range. # Img. (Slant): Number of images in slant range.</div>

### Classification

For classification based on amplitude data, we have chosen six computer vision methods ([VGG16](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.1556), [ResNet18](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385), [ResNet34](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385), [ConvNeXt](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.03545)) and two SAR ATR methods ([HDANet](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10283916), [SARATR-X](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10856784)). We provide the codes and hyperparameter settings in the Pytorch environment, and the corresponding weights and result files can be downloaded via the dataset link.
